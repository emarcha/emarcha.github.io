        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Manny, <a href="http://www.choosechicago.com/" target="_blank">Chicago</a>
          entrepreneur and developer, looking to provide value by creatively solving problems.
          I'm incredibly fascinated by design and the application of technology. In other words,
          how to craft a sleek, beautiful, and accessible solution.

        <h3>Work</h3>
        <p>
          I've held a variety of jobs, each offering me a unique perspective of
          a new and different field. For example, during high school I learned about
          audio engineering and reinforcing live musical performances. In college, I
          gained a deeper understanding of customer service and functional layout
          design. After undergrad, I learned about full stack development, app
          deployment, and business/resource management. I could write paragraphs,
          but my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuelmarcha" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> account probably does a better job.

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
          I haven't strayed far during my education pursuits. For high school I
          attended Whitney Young, a magnet school located in Chicago's Near West
          Side. After graduation I was attended the Illinois Institute of Technology
          for  5 years, working on a degree in
          <a href="http://www.iit.edu/engineering/chbe/" target="_blank">chemical engineering</a>
          and
          <a href="http://www.iit.edu/csl/cs/" target="_blank">computer science</a>.
