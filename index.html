I'm Manny, <a href="http://www.choosechicago.com/" target=_blank>Chicago</a> entrepreneur and developer, looking to provide value by creatively solving problems. I'm incredibly fascinated by design and the application of technology. In other words, how to craft a sleek, beautiful, and accessible solution.</p></section><!-- Work --><section id=work><h3>Work</h3><p>I've held a variety of jobs, each offering me a unique perspective of a new and different field. For example, during high school I learned about audio engineering and reinforcing live musical performances. In college, I gained a deeper understanding of customer service and functional layout design. After undergrad, I learned about full stack development, app deployment, and business/resource management. I could write paragraphs, but my <a href=http://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuelmarcha target=_blank>LinkedIn</a> account probably does a better job.</p></section><!-- Eduction --><section id=education><h3>Education</h3><p>I haven't strayed far during my education pursuits. For high school I attended Whitney Young, a magnet school located in Chicago's Near West Side. After graduation I was attended the Illinois Institute of Technology for 5 years, working on a degree in <a href="http://www.iit.edu/engineering/chbe/" target=_blank>chemical engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.iit.edu/csl/cs/" target=_blank>computer science</a>.</p></section><!-- Projects --><section id=projects><h3>Projects</h3><p>Detailed list of projects coming soon.</p></section></div></div></div><footer></footer><script src=/js/scripts.25d2.js></script></body></html>
